# SwiftUI User Listing and Detail Screen Example
This is a simple SwiftUI example that demonstrates a user listing and detail screen, including the ability to search for users. It showcases the basic usage of SwiftUI views, navigation, data binding, and search functionality.

# Features
User Listing: The app displays a list of users, where each user's name is shown as a list item.
User Details: Tapping on a user in the list navigates to a detail screen that displays the user's name and email.
User Search: The app includes a search bar that allows users to search for specific users by name. The search functionality filters the user list in real-time as the user types in the search bar.

# Requirements
Xcode 12.0 or later
iOS 14.0 or later

# Installation
Clone or download the repository.
Open the project in Xcode.
Build and run the app on the iOS Simulator or a physical device.

# Usage
The app starts with the user listing screen, where users are displayed in a list. Tapping on a user navigates to the user details screen, showing the user's name and email.

To search for a user, simply enter the user's name in the search bar at the top of the user listing screen. The user list will be filtered in real-time based on the search query.

You can customize the user data by modifying the users array in the ContentView. Feel free to add or remove users as needed.
